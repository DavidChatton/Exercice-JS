Make a business application that calculates the insurance premium for a customer.

Recall the statement from the algorithm course :

A car insurance company offers its customers four families of tariffs identifiable by a colour, from least to most expensive: 
* blue 
* green
* orange
* red tariffs

The rate depends on the driver's situation :

* A driver under 25 years of age who has held a licence for less than two years is assigned the red rate, provided he or she has never been responsible for an accident. Otherwise, the company refuses to insure him.

* A driver under 25 years of age and licensed for more than two years, or over 25 years of age but licensed for less than two years, is entitled to the orange rate if he or she has never caused an accident, and to the red rate for an accident, otherwise he or she is refused.

* A driver over 25 who has held a licence for more than two years is entitled to the green tariff if he or she has not caused any accidents and to the orange tariff for one accident, to the red tariff for two accidents, and refused beyond that.

* In addition, to encourage the loyalty of accepted clients, the company offers a contract of the most advantageous colour immediately if he has been with the company for more than a year.

**In any case, a driver who has had more than three accidents is refused.**

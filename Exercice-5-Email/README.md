Write a JavaScript program that asks a user to enter an email address via a form : 

example: monadresse@mail.com

* Your program must determine whether the address provided by the user is valid or not.

* To do this, analyse the string and find out if there is an "@" and a ".

* Make sure that the dot is present behind the arrobase.

* Find a way to check the email without a button for your form.

Warning: Do not use the type 'email' in your input field.
